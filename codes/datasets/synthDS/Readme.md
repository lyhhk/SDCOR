All synthetic datasets are uploaded to the [Mendeley Data data center](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/p4tx2k852r/2), and have been crafted through MATLAB 9 for various experimental purposes. There are 4 datasets for the experiment of "Accuracy and Stability Analysis", 11 datasets for "Tolerance to a High Number of Outliers" experiment, and finally 10 datasets for the "Scalability test". In all these artificial datasets, there are different types of Gaussian clusters along with some specific amount of outliers injected around every individual Normal cluster.

More information on the artificially generated datasets and how they have been created is available along with the data at the presented link, and also, you can find more specific details in the associated scientific paper.
